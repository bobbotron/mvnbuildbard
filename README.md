# Maven Build Bard

Maven build bard is a small maven lifecycle listener that reacts to maven build events to play notes via JFugue (http://www.jfugue.org/).  This is currently set up to build on Java 8 but should build on later java platforms with no problem.



## Installation
To install locally, build this project and then copy the output jar file to your local <MAVEN_HOME>/lib/ext/ directory.
